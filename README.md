## Installation

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the **Frontend Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leisuretech24/Leisuretech.git
   ```

2. The project should be hosted on **Cloudflare Pages**. Go to your Cloudflare account and follow the [Cloudflare Pages documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) to set up the site.

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the **Backend Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leisuretech24/stripe--payment-integration.git
   ```

2. Deploy the backend code on a server or hosting provider supporting PHP.

3. Link the frontend with backend URLs in the frontend codebase if necessary.

4. Upload the backend ZIP file (located in the frontend repo) to allow Cloudflare Pages to serve it, enabling users to download it if needed.

## Configuration

### Stripe Integration

1. Obtain your **Stripe API keys** from your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).

2. Configure the keys in the backend code. Typically, this will involve setting environment variables or placing the keys directly in your PHP configuration file (not recommended for production).

   - **Publishable Key** (for the frontend) and **Secret Key** (for the backend) should be set as per your Stripe setup.

3. Adjust any other backend configurations related to payment and product handling.

---

## Stripe Integration

- **Frontend**: Stripe elements are used for secure payment capture in the frontend.
- **Backend**: Uses Stripe’s API for processing payments and confirming transactions. Make sure to configure webhooks for real-time payment updates if required.

---

## Usage

- **User Navigation**: Users can browse products and services, configure custom PCs, and make payments through a secure Stripe integration.
- **Admin Access**: Use backend endpoints to manage orders, update inventory, or handle user queries.
